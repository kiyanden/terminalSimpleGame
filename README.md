# Terminal - Simple Game
One of my first games on Unity. Extremely simple and funny. I hope that I will come here in 3 years and be horrified by what bad code I wrote.

The goal of the game is to crack the password on various levels. For this, you will receive a small reward. Also hidden in the game is an Easter egg, which is difficult to find.
